# GLFragmentShader

Simple full-window GL fragment shader using GLFW and glad.

## Compiling

Build tested with CMake 3.23 and Visual Studio 2022 on Windows.

## Dependencies

Building requires CMake 3.5 or later. All dependencies are built into the repository, so no additional work is needed to include them.

The following dependencies are included in the `deps` folder:

- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) GL context manager.
- [Glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) GL loader code generated using the [online glad2 build system](https://gen.glad.sh/)
